# COMWORK CLOUD CLI (CWC cli)

`cwc` is a CLI written in go that will help you to manipulate the [comwork cloud API](./README.md) avoiding the breaking changes.

As it's written in go, it's pretty easy to ship into your IaC pipelines.

Documentation: you'll find everything you need [here](https://doc.cloud.comwork.io/docs/tutorials/api/cli).
